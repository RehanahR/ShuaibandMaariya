This repository creates a webpage that queries a .csv file (with full names, seating arrangement table number allocations and family groups-FamilyID) for a user input (name) and returns the assigned table number allocation from the seating arrangement, for that input.

It also finds associated family members and can display their seating arrangement table allocations, as well.
